# NutriGenome - Quantum AI-Powered Personalized Meal Planner 

This project builds a complete genomics-to-nutrition pipeline using synthetic SNP data, quantum-inspired neural networks, and language-model-driven recommendation logic. The goal is to generate adaptive, evidence-aligned meal plans based on a userâ€™s polygenic risk profileâ€”all accessible via a lightweight web interface.

## ðŸ§ª Genetic Risk Modeling

The process begins with simulated SNP data reflecting key nutrition-relevant traitsâ€”liver cirrhosis, BMI, and iron absorption. For each individual, the code randomly generates genotypes (0, 1, 2 copies of a risk allele) across curated SNPs. Using published beta coefficients, it computes polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each trait. Based on quantized thresholds, individuals are labeled "HIGH" or "LOW" riskâ€”creating a labeled dataset of synthetic genomic profiles.

This dataset is stored in structured CSVs (e.g., `bmi_generated_data.csv`, `liver_generated_data.csv`) and serves as the training/test bed for downstream models.

## ðŸ§  Quantum Neural Network (QNN) Integration

Implements a post variational quantum neural network to learn correlations between genetic profiles and nutrition categories. While not run on real quantum hardware, the QNN architecture introduces entanglement-like interactions between features to capture non-linear dependencies that classical linear models might miss.

The modelâ€™s goal is to recommend diet types (e.g., high-protein, low-carb, etc.) given a PRS vector.

## ðŸ§¬ LLM-Powered Meal Generation

Once a nutrition class is inferred, a prompt-based system powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT models takes over. The `meal.py` script structures these prompts dynamicallyâ€”tailoring content based on risk scores, lifestyle flags (e.g., vegetarian), and known restrictions (e.g., lactose intolerance). The generated meal plans are structured, context-aware, and consistent across runs.

This hybrid approach bridges hardcoded SNP risk scoring with generative flexibilityâ€”producing meal plans that feel both medically grounded and personalized.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Connection Error**
   - Ensure Flask server is running on port 8000
   - Check CORS settings in backend/app.py
   - Verify API_BASE_URL in src/lib/api.ts

2. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Check API key permissions and quota
   - Ensure proper model access (gpt-4o-mini)

3. **Genomic File Upload**
   - Ensure file is .txt format
   - Check file size (should be reasonable)
   - Verify file contains valid genomic data

4. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
   - Verify import paths are correct
